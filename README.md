# x15-compensator
The X15 Compensator is a lightweight, system-tray utility written in AutoHotkey v2.0. It is designed specifically to solve the "reverse-scroll" jitter common in the EVGA X15 MMO Mouse. By implementing a time-based directional lock, the software filters out mechanical "bounces" from the encoder before they reach Windows.
